;;; Commentary:
;; 
;; This mode implements a number of helper functions that organize :
;; 1. traversal of the tree of includes declarations in c/c++ files
;; 2. get list of files that coresponds to includes of tree traversal algorithm.
;;    Using a variable to define system include locations. 
;;    Using this variable and relative definitions of #include directive to existance check
;; 3. Unify entries of the list and return this as result
;; 4. generate etags file using project path as argument of this function
;;
