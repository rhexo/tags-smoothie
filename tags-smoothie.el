;;; Commentary:
;; 
;; This mode implements a number of helper functions that organize :
;; 1. traversal of the tree of includes declarations in c/c++ files
;; 2. get list of files that coresponds to includes of tree traversal algorithm.
;;    Using a variable to define system include locations. 
;;    Using this variable and relative definitions of #include directive to existance check
;; 3. Unify entries of the list and return this as result
;; 4. generate etags file using project path as argument of this function
;;
;;; Code:


(defvar tags-smoothie-project-dir (nil)
  "TAGS file dir as project dir")

(defun tags-smoothie-project-traversal (string)
  "Traversal sources tree. Parse project sources and gets it`'s includes as list."
  (setq tags-smoothie-project-dir 'string))


(defun tags-smoothie-parse-file (string)
  "Get list of #include declarations in file."
  (""))

(defun tags-smoothie-get-project-files ()
  "Retrieve c/c++ project files."
  )

;;; Customization
(defgroup tags-smoothie nil
  "etags generation algorithm."
  :group 'tools)

(defcustom tags-smoothie-include-path "/usr/include/"
  "external and system include paths that uses in c/c++ project files."
  :group 'tags-smoothie
  :type '(repeat string))
